                <h2>The basics - What is an operating system?</h2>
                <p>According to Wikipedia, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">
                    operating system</a>  is software that manages hardware, 
                software, resources, and provides some amount of services for
                program execution.</p>
                <p>Both unix style operating systems and Windows both give users
                the ability to interface with the computer via command line or
                GUI. The most common set of Unix operating systems belong to one
                distrubution of Linux.</p>
                <h2>Differences between Windows and Unix operating systems</h2>
                <p>Windows was designed around the GUI, and some more advanced
                tasks can be performed using the command line. Linux can be used
                the same way, or be run entirely from command line depending entirely
                on the Linux distrubution chosen.</p>
                <h2>A Few Advantages of Windows</h2>
                <ul class="bullet_list">
                    <li>Easier to learn</li>
                    <li>Better backward compatibility</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>A Few Advantages of Linux</h2>
                <ul class="bullet_list">
                    <li>Better stability</li>
                    <li>Better processing power</li>
                    <li>Better built-in security</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="summary">Summary</h2>
                <p>The operating system that you choose should be based off of
                your needs. If you need something to just simply use that works
                well with little effort, then Windows may suit your needs. Unbuntu
                is a linux distrubution that is known for being very easy to setup
                and use. If you need something that requires a more custom setup,
                that needs to be fast, lightweight, and roubust, then a form of
                Unix may be the right choice for you.</p>
